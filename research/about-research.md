# About Research

Being an author is not just about writing; it's also about research. Research is the backbone of any good book, providing the facts, figures, and context that enrich your narrative. Keystone recognizes this need and provides a dedicated space for your research materials.

Whether you are working on a fictional narrative that requires extensive world-building or a technology book where you need to keep your facts straight, the `research/` directory is where you can keep all your notes, references, and citations organized.

Note that Keystone shines when paired with a source control system like Git. This allows you to track changes in your research, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of your work.
