## System Packages

These are the packages the engine image asks Ubuntu's archive for. Each package's source is
`https://packages.ubuntu.com/<name>`, and its copyright file ships in the image at `/usr/share/doc/<name>/copyright` —
stating the terms outright, or naming a license whose text is at `/usr/share/common-licenses/<license>` in the same
image.

Installing them brings the other packages the distribution says they need. Those are redistributed as part of Ubuntu's
own package set rather than chosen here, and each carries its copyright file the same way.

The image is built on the published `pandoc/minimal` image, redistributed unmodified. Pandoc itself is listed above; the
rest of what that image carries is Ubuntu's package set on the same terms, documented the same way. Packages built from
one source share a copyright file, so a package without one of its own is covered by the file of another built from the
same source.

### Font rendering

How XeLaTeX reaches the fonts installed outside TeX Live.

- [MIT-style permissive (the fontconfig license)](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/fontconfig/fontconfig/-/blob/main/COPYING):
  fontconfig (font discovery for XeLaTeX), libfontconfig1 (the fontconfig library itself)
- [FreeType License (FTL)](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freetype/freetype/-/blob/master/docs/FTL.TXT): libfreetype6
  (the library XeLaTeX renders glyphs with)

### Engine tools

Command-line programs the pipeline runs as subprocesses.

- [GNU Lesser General Public License v2 or later](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.0.html): librsvg2-bin
  (rsvg-convert, which Pandoc shells out to for SVG to PDF)
- [GNU General Public License v2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html): socat (the client the engine
  uses to reach a hook's Unix socket)

## TeX Live Packages

Installed via `install-tl` and `tlmgr` from a pinned tlnet snapshot, each license as the TeX Live catalogue records it
for that package. Font packages are attributed under Fonts, as are `lm` and `lm-math`, which are installed for the
default and math fonts.

Hyphenation patterns (`hyphen-basque` through `hyphen-swedish`) ship via [hyph-utf8](https://ctan.org/pkg/hyph-utf8).
Each file under `/opt/texlive/texdir/texmf-dist/tex/generic/hyph-utf8/patterns/tex/` in the image carries its own
copyright and license in its header. Terms vary by language, and by file within a language, so no single license covers
the set.

### Base LaTeX / XeLaTeX packages

The general engine and pandoc-template closure, with the language files an author selects via `lang:`. Each package's
source is `https://ctan.org/pkg/<name>`.

- [LPPL 1.2](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/): upquote

- [LPPL 1.3c](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/): amsmath, babel-french, babel-italian, bidi, bookmark, booktabs,
  fontspec, footnotehyper, geometry, graphics, iftex, latex, microtype, parskip, tools, unicode-math, xcolor
- [SIL Open Font License](https://openfontlicense.org/): amsfonts (AMS math symbol fonts)
- Free (permissive, redistribution allowed): ec (EC font metrics, required by soul), framed, ulem
- [X11/MIT License](https://spdx.org/licenses/X11.html): xetex

### Keystone feature packages

The packages Keystone's own features need. Each package's source is `https://ctan.org/pkg/<name>`.

- [LPPL 1.2](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/): endnotes (collected endnotes, gathered at the end of a document),
  psnfss (provides pifont.sty for Dingbat symbols)
- [LPPL 1.3](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/): fancyhdr (page layout, via page-layout-fancyhdr.tex), fvextra
  (fancyvrb extensions for code listings), tcolorbox (colored boxes for callout and aside blocks), tikzfill (fill
  patterns, a tcolorbox skins dependency)
- [LPPL 1.3c](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/): draftwatermark (watermark overlay for draft documents), hyperxmp
  (embeds keywords and metadata into the PDF Info dict and XMP stream), koma-script (KOMA-Script document classes, plus
  scrlayer-scrpage.sty), lettrine (drop caps), lineno (line numbering, used by pandoc), pdfcol (color stacks, a
  tcolorbox skins dependency), ragged2e (hyphenation-preserving ragged-right)

## Fonts

These font families ship in the Keystone Docker image, each with its own license text beside its font files under
`/opt/keystone/fonts/`. Each is an independent work distributed alongside Keystone (mere aggregation under GPL Section
2), and all permit redistribution and EPUB embedding.
