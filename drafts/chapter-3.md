# Advanced Keystone Project Structure

Keystone projects can be complex, and understanding the structure is key to effective writing.

Drafts are important as they allow you to create snippets, ideas, or even entire chapters that are not yet ready for publication. They can be used to store work-in-progress content that you can refine later.

Once the draft chapter is ready, move it to the `chapters/` directory and include it in the `publish.txt` file. This helps keep your project organized and ensures that only polished content is included in the final output.
